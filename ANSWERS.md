- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

    -since hooks are really new to the community there might be some behavior that is unknown to other developers. There is alos less documentation but other than I dont think theres a difference, anything that can be achieved in classes can be also achived in hooks.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
    
    - componentDidMount: checks and make sure the components are all mounted then executed a bllock of code
    - componentDidUpdate: check if the state has change 
    - componentWillUnmount: will be invoked as soon as a component is unmounted and destroyed

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

    - create cleaner and reusable code

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

    -easier to debug hence less time spent debugging more time spent making the product awesome.
